# Vega-lite documentation
The best place to read about Vega-lite code is on the official Vega-lite website: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/, but I also have some help here and the next few pages to get you started.

When using the Vega-Lite website, here are some pointers:
- Top navigation bar is a great way to jump between [**Examples**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) and the [**Documentation**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/)
- The [**Documentation**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/) home page has a search bar.
- Almost every example in the [**Documentation**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/) is a live visual, shows the code, and has a link to open the code in the online Editor. Don't just cruise the [**Examples**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) looking for code. Often the best code for what you are looking for may be in the [**Documentation**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/)!
- Use the left nav bar to find what you are looking for when writing code
  - The [**Encoding**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/encoding.html) links aren't what you might expect, and actually make learning about encodings a little more difficult. Encoding channels are things like `x`, `y`, `color`, `size`, and `text`. They are the next level after `encoding`. The links on the nav bar are properties of `encoding` channels, so they are next level after an encoding **channel**. For whatever reason, the left nav bar doesn't list encoding channels. To find the doc for a specific encoding channel, eg. `color`, click the link for the [`Encoding` page](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/encoding.html) and use the links at the top of the page.
