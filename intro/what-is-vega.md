# What is Vega?
Visualizations on the web are typically created using JavaScript libraries like the popular [D3 library](https://d3js.org/). Microsoft's Power BI visuals are all created using D3.

D3 is really difficult to write, so Vega is a different language for creating visualizations. It is powerful like D3, but much easier to write.

Vega is still a little too complicated, and so there is a paired-down version of Vega called "Vega-lite" which is very simple but allows you to completely control almost every aspect of a visual.

Beginners start with Vega-lite, and then when you start hitting limitations, you can easily make the jump to Vega and then stick with it.
